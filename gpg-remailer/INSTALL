To Install skeleton by hand instead of using the binary distribution perform
the following steps:

    0. To build the gpg-remailer the following programs/packages must be
        available:
            libbobcat3 (>= 3.16.00), libbobcat-dev (>= 3.16.00), 
            icmake (>= 7.21.00), g++ (>= 4.8.1), and
            yodl (>= 3.00.0) if you want to create the man-page.

       To use the gpg-remailer /usr/bin/gpg and /usr/bin/mail must be
        available.

    1. Inspect the values of the variables in the file INSTALL.im Modify these
       when necessary. The default destinations are:

        * For the man-page:                 /usr/share/man/man1/
        * For additional documentation:     /usr/share/doc/gpg-remailer/

    2. The binary program is at ./tmp/bin/binary. Using the 'build' script it
        can be installed in a directory of your choice. To see build's options
        call ./build without arguments.

    3. ./build program creates the program
       ./build man creates the man-page
