manpagedescription()

    A remailer program decrypts received PGP/GPG messages, verifies
the received signature and re-encrypts the e-mail for a well defined group
of recipients. It concentrates the membership of a group of people who want to
exchange encrypted and authenticated e-amil to one location, allowing the
members of the groupg to specify just one e-mail address to send PGP/GPG
signed and encrypted e-mail to. 

    The reencrypting remailer reads incoming e-mail from its standard input
stream and sends the processed input as a signed and encrypted PGP/GPG e-mail 
to all the group members. 

    A configuration file as well as command line options can be used to
fine-tune the remailer's behavior. 

manpagesection(REQUIREMENTS)

    In order to use the re-encrypting remailer the following requirements must
be met:
    itemization(
    it() Since multiple groups may use a reencrypting remailer it is advised
to define functional accounts handling e-mail to be processed by the
reencrypting remailer. A functional account can be defined using the command 
    verb(
    adduser --home /var/lib/secmail --disabled-password secmail
    )
    it() All locations used by the remailer must be given highly restrictive
permissions. E.g., use tt(chmod -R og-rwx /var/lib/secmail) for the functional
accounts. The reencrypting remailer will not process e-mail unless these
permissions were set. 
    it() Consider making all functional remailer accounts members of a special
group (e.g., tt(remailer)) and allow execution of tt(/usr/sbin/remailer) only
my members of that group:
        verb(
    addgroup remailer
    adduser secmail remailer
    chown root.remailer /usr/sbin/remailer
    chmod o-rx /usr/bin/remailer
    )    
    it() To allow the functional account to handle incoming e-mail
bf(sudo)(1) can be used. In the file tt(/etc/sudoers) the following lines can
be entered (tt(REMAILERS) can be given a comma separated list of functional
account names, tt(mailhost.org) should be replaced by the name of your host
handling the incoming e-mail):
    verb(
Runas_Alias REMAILERS = secmail

mail    mailhost.org=(REMAILERS) NOPASSWD:  /usr/sbin/remailer
    )
    it() An e-mail address is defined to where the mail to reencrypt must be
sent. This e-mail address must be known by the members of the group who want
to use the remailer. Such an account could be, e.g., tt(secmail@mailhost.org),
appearing as a defined mail address in, e.g., tt(/etc/mail/aliases). A
definition like the following could be entered in the tt(/etc/mail/aliases)
file:
    verb(
    secmail:         "|sudo -u secmail /usr/sbin/remailer"
    )
    it() The functional account must be provided with a GPG/PGP keypair. Its
public key must be distributed over the people who are allowed to send mail to
the remailer (which may be the world if the public key is published at a PGP
key server). Since the remailer must be able to act on its own, the secret key
must not require a passphrase. The key can be created as follows (execute the
initial command as tt(root):
        verb(
    su - secmail
    gpg --gen-key
    exit
        )
    At the tt(gpg --gen-key) command the tt(gpg) program asks for several
details. Accept the defaults unless you have reason not to, but make sure you
do not require a pass phrase by pressing tt(Enter) twice when asked for one.
Some additional suggestions:

Decrypting key without password: 

    define default  DSA key, size 1024, never to expire+nl()
    real name: secmail remailer functional account+nl()
    email address: secmail@mailhost.org+nl()
No passphrase required: press 2 x enter.+nl()

Edit this gpg key, and add a subkey, EIGamal for encryption only (addkey) Use
tt(--search-keys) or tt(--recv-keys) or tt(--import) to provide the pseudo
user's public key ring with the group member's public keys, and add the names
or key-ids to the `members' definition in secmail's tt(gnupg/gpg.conf) file

Add tt(force-mdc) to gpg.conf. 
This prevents the `WARNING: message was not integrity protected' warning.
If you want non-group members to send e-mail to the remailer consider
adding tt(keyserver wwwkeys.eu.pgp.net) to gpg.conf

    If a member exists who has signed the GPG/PGP keys of all other members,
then consider to trust this member fully, to prevent warnings resulting from
using untrusted keys.
    it() Once the remailer's GPG key pair has been created, distribute the
public key over the members of the group. These members should import the
public key and they should be advised to sign the key to prevent warnings
about using an unverified public key. The key could be exported using 
        verb(
    gpg --armor --export secmail > secmail.pub
        )
    and the members of the group can import the public key using:
        verb(
    gpg --import secmail.pub
        )
    it() Conversely, all public keys of all group members must be obtained and
added to the functional account's public keyring. When a new member is added
to the group he/she should add the functional account's public key to his/her
public key and provide his/her public key for import into the functional
account's public key ring. 
    it() The remailer requires the existence of a configuration file and of a
directory to store its temporary files in. See below.    
    )

manpagesection(RETURN VALUE)

    The remailer program always returns 0 to the operating system to prevent
tt(unknown mailer error) messages in the MTA's logs. However, when the
remailer ends prematurely an error message is written to the standard error
stream.

manpageoptions()

    If available, single letter options are listed between parentheses
following their associated long-option variants. Single letter options require
arguments if their associated long options require arguments as well.
    itemization(
    it() Several more: to do
COMMENT(
    it() lsoption(config-file)(c)(filename)nl()
           The name of an bf(xd) configuration file. By default bf(xd) will
            look for the file tt(.xdrc) in the user's home directory. The
            existence of the default file is optional.
)
    it() loption(help) (soption(h))nl()
           Basic usage information is written to the standard output stream.
    it() loption(version) (soption(v))nl()
           The remailer's version number is is written to the standard output
            stream. 
    )
    

manpagesection(CONFGURATION FILE)

The default configuration file is tt(etc/remailer.rc) under the user's home
directory. It may be overruled by a command line argument.

Empty lines are ignored. Information at and beyond tt(#)-characters is
interpreted as comment and is ignored as well.

All directives in bf(xd) configuration files follow the pattern 
    verb(
    directive: value
    ) 

A line may at most contain one directive, but white space (including comment
at the end of the line) is OK. Several directives may be specified multiple
times; otherwise the first occurrence of a directive is used. All directives
are interpreted em(case sensitively), but their values are used as
specified. E.g., tt(DeBUG: true) is as good as tt(debug: true), but tt(debug:
TRUE) is not recognized.  Non-empty lines not beginning with a recognized
directive are silently ignored.

    The following directives were defined (default values are shown between
parentheses; when none specified there is no default). When equivalent 
command line options are used then they overrule the configuration file
specifications.
    itemization(
    it() bf(debug:) tt(logic) (false)nl()
        When specified as tt(true) debug messages will be logged to the
log-file (see below). Command line options: tt(--debug, -d). When this option 
is specified the files written by the remailer will not be removed when the
remailer terminates.
    it() bf(keepFiles:) tt(nr) nl()
        When a number is specified all files written by the remailer will use
the specified number and will not be removed when the remailer
terminates. When this option is not specified the files will have a random
number resulting in the creation of a new, as yet non-existing tt(org.<nr>)
file. No existency check is performed on the other files written by the
remailer. 
    it() bf(logfile:) tt(filename) (etc/remailer.log)nl()
        The file on which the remailer's log messages are written.
    it() bf(loglevel:) tt(value) (2)nl()
        LogLevel 0 provides extensive debug output as well as all other
            logmessages;nl()  
        LogLevel 1 logs the executed commands and the default messages;nl()
        LogLevel 2 logs the default messages (characteristics of incoming and
            outgoing e-mail);nl()
        Higher levels will suppress logging. 
    it() bf(noMail:) tt(logic) (false)nl()
        When specified as tt(true) mail will not be sent.
    it() bf(recipient:) tt(e-mail address) nl()
        Multiple recipients may be specified. Recipients should be specified
as a plain e-mail address (e.g., tt(destination@some.host.org)). The
re-encrypted mail will be sent to each recipient in turn.
    it() bf(replyTo:) tt(full address) nl()
        The reply to address may be any e-mail reply-to address. The reply-to
will be shown to the receiver when he/she wants to send a reply. Quotes and
double quotes are removed from the reply to address. A reply to specification
could be, e.g.,
        verb(
    SEC MAIL signed AND encrypted <secmail@mailhost.org>
        )
    it() bf(signature:) tt(requirement) (required)nl()
        This option is used to control signature checking. Recognized values
are:nl()
        tt(none) (or not specified): no signature checking is performed;nl()
        tt(required): a PGP signature must have been provided;nl()
        tt(good): the PGP signature must be recognized as a a `good
        signature'. 
    it() bf(tmp) tt(directory) (tmp/)nl()
        The directory into which the remailer will write its temporary files.
